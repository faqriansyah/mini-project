# Mini Project

Hey, thanks for stumbling upon my GitHub! 🙌 This is where I toss all my personal projects—basically my digital junk drawer, but with (hopefully) cooler stuff. Expect a mix of code experiments, half-baked ideas, and whatever shiny new tech caught my attention this week. Feel free to snoop around!

# What’s This About?
This repo is my personal playground where I try to make sense of coding and occasionally look like I know what I'm doing. Some of it is original work (when inspiration strikes), but let’s be real, a lot of it’s me following tutorials while hoping not to break the internet. Wherever I’ve copied stuff—I mean, been inspired—by tutorials, I’ve dropped the links so you can follow along or laugh at my attempts.

# Project Breakdown
Okay, so here’s the deal: most of what you’ll find here is JavaScript. Why? Well, because I live in the web dev world, and JS is basically my second language at this point. I’d apologize for that, but, you know, JavaScript. You might also see a sprinkle of other languages or frameworks, but don’t get too excited—JS is still the star of this show. If you’re looking for specifics, each folder has its own README that should help (unless I forgot to write one, in which case... good luck!).

# Do Whatever You Want With It
Go ahead and grab this code—break it, fix it, remix it, whatever floats your boat. There are no strings attached here. I’m not gonna hunt you down if you use it for personal or even professional stuff (though if you make millions off it, I wouldn’t say no to a pizza or two). Feel free to use this repo as your personal sandbox. Fork it, tear it apart, or just stare at it like I do when something inevitably breaks.

# Shoutout to the Inspirations
Full disclosure: I didn’t come up with everything in here. A lot of it is the product of following tutorials while muttering, “Wait, what did I just do?” Wherever I’ve borrowed (read: shamelessly stolen) ideas, I’ve linked to the original sources so you can check them out if you want to learn or see what I was trying to do before I got distracted.

# Wanna Help?
Sure, this is mostly my own little coding workshop, but if you’ve got ideas or improvements, I’m all ears! If you see something broken (which is likely), feel free to submit a pull request or drop an issue. The door’s always open—just be prepared for the chaos that is my code.

# Thanks for Swinging By!
Anyway, thanks for popping in! I hope you find something here that makes you go, "Huh, neat!" or at least doesn’t break your computer. Happy coding, keep learning, and may your bugs be easy to find (and even easier to fix)! 🚀
